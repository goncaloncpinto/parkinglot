# parkinglot
A small parking lot management example software

This program uses an MS SQL local database, you won't have access to it as it is stored in my local server, there is a commented connection string for my other local server connection for a MariaDB database.
If you want to run this program, you will need the missing libraries and crete a database on your own with the 3 needed tables.
